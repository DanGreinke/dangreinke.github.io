# Quick and Easy Fudge Brownies
From King Arthur Flour

## Ingredients 
* 1 cup (120g) All-Purpose Flour
* ¾ cup (64g) unsweetened cocoa, Dutch-process or natural
* 1 ¾  cups (347g) granulated sugar
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon espresso powder, optional; for enhanced chocolate flavor
* 3 large eggs
* 8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter, melted
* ¼ cup (50g) vegetable oil
* 2 teaspoons King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract
* 1 cup (170g) semisweet chocolate chips, optional

## Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan.
2. Put all of the ingredients into a large bowl in the order in which they're written. Stir, then beat the mixture until it's smooth.
3. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.
4. Bake the brownies for about 25 minutes, or until they're just barely beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan. A toothpick inserted into the center will come out clean or with a few moist crumbs clinging to it; you shouldn't see any wet batter.
5. Remove the brownies from the oven; let them cool completely before cutting.
6. Store any leftover brownies, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 to 6 days. Freeze for longer storage.

## Rebecca’s Notes:
* I usually bake these in an 8” x 8” glass dish. Increase baking time to 30+ minutes, until a knife comes out with only a few crumbs. This was a favorite when we lived in SF because it didn’t use a lot of dishes, and the 8” x 8” dish fit into our toaster oven.
* I also dust these with sifted powdered sugar while they are still warm.
