# Scottish Shortbread
From Sunset Magazine

## Ingredients:

* 1 cup (1/2 lb.) butter, at room temperature
* 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
* 6 tablespoons cornstarch
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

## Directions:

1.  In a bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter, 1/2 cup sugar, and cornstarch until smooth; stir in flour until mixture is no longer crumbly and starts to come together in a ball.
2.  Press dough evenly into two 9-inch round pans with removable rims. Press edges of dough with fork tines to make a ridge pattern. Then, with fork tines, pierce dough all over in parallel lines 1 inch apart.
3.  Bake shortbread in a 300°F (150°C) oven until firm to touch and golden at edges, about 45 minutes.
4.  Sprinkle while hot with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, then let cool for 10 minutes.
5.  Remove pan rims from warm shortbread. Cut each round into 12 wedges. Cool completely on pan bottoms on racks.

## Rebecca’s Notes:

* You can also dip the finished cookies in melted chocolate, and let them solidify on wax paper.
* I’ve also made this recipe into shapes with a cookie-cutter.
