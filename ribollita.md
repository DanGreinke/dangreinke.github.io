# Ribollita - Integer Recipe Version
Adapted from From Dan Giusti & Epicurious/The Smart Cook

## Ingredients

* 1 package mirepoix from Trader Joe’s (about 4 oz each of diced onion, carrot, and celery)
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* Olive oil
* 1 14-oz can crushed tomatoes
* 1 14-oz can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
* 6 cups water
* 1 package chopped kale
* 2-3 slices bread
* Grated Parmesan cheese (for topping)

## Directions

1.  Cook mirepoix and garlic in a large pot with olive oil on low heat until softened.
2.  Add tomatoes, beans, and water to the pot.
3.  Break up stale bread and add it to the pot.
4.  Simmer for 10-15 minutes, the bread should thicken up the soup.
5.  Ladle soup into oven-safe bowls sitting on top of a baking sheet.
6.  Tear pieces of bread and float on top of soup, drizzle them with olive oil and grated parmesan.
7.  Broil until cheese turns golden brown.

## Rebecca’s Notes

* You might have to add the kale in stages, it will cook down and fit into the pot eventually!
* Reheat leftover soup on the stove or microwave, then top with bread and cheese, then broil.
* We haven't tried the topping with thawed frozen bread yet, but lightly toasting it to defrost should prevent sogginess.
* You can make your own mirepoix by dicing carrot, onion and celery in equal amounts, then freeze for later.
