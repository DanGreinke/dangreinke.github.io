# West African Peanut Soup
Adapted from Cookie + Kate

## Ingredients

*   1 32-oz carton low-sodium vegetable broth (4 cups)
*   2 cups water
*   1 medium red onion, chopped
*   2 tablespoons peeled and minced fresh ginger
*   4 cloves garlic, minced
*   1 teaspoon salt (less if using salted peanut butter - taste first)
*   1 bunch kale, ribs removed and leaves chopped into 1-inch strips
*   ¾ cup peanut butter
*   1 6-oz can tomato paste
*   Hot sauce, like sriracha, to taste
*   ¼ cup roughly chopped peanuts, for garnish
*   1 sweet potato, chopped
*   Cooked brown rice, for serving (optional)

## Directions

1.  Combine the broth, water, and sweet potato in a medium Dutch oven or stock pot. Bring the mixture to a boil, then add the onion, ginger, garlic, and salt. Cook on medium-low heat for 20 minutes.
2.  In a medium-sized, heat-safe mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter and tomato paste, then transfer 1 to 2 cups of the hot stock to the bowl. Whisk the mixture together until smooth, then pour the peanut mixture back into the soup and mix well.
3.  Stir in the kale.
4.  Season the soup with hot sauce to taste.
5.  Simmer for about 15 more minutes on medium-low heat, stirring often. Season with additional salt or hot sauce if desired.
6.  Serve over cooked brown rice if you’d like, and top with a sprinkle of chopped peanuts.

## Rebecca’s Notes

*   We increased the tomato paste to make this an integer recipe, just use the whole can.
*   We added in sweet potato.
*   We usually serve this with brown rice; it’s a good way to use up leftover cooked rice.
