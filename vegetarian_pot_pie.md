# Vegetarian Pot Pie
Adapted from Well Plated by Erin

I’ve only done one trial of this recipe so far, some planned adjustments are in the notes at the bottom.

## Ingredients

* Double pie crust
* 1 container of mirepoix from Trader Joe’s (about 4 oz each of diced onion, carrot, celery)
* 1 8-oz container of sliced brown mushrooms
* 3 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* ¼ teaspoon black pepper
* ¼ cup all-purpose flour
* 2 cups milk (1 pint)
* 1 15-oz can white beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
* 1 egg

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
2.  Melt butter in a large pot. Add mushrooms and cook for about 6 minutes, until they begin to brown, stirring occasionally.
3.  Add the mirepoix, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook until the mushrooms have browned more deeply and the vegetables begin to soften, about 3 additional minutes.
4.  Sprinkle the flour over the top of the vegetables and cook 2 minutes, until the white disappears (the vegetables will seem dry). Slowly pour in the milk, stirring constantly. Bring to a low boil, scraping any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Continue to let bubble until thickened, about 3 to 5 minutes, stirring very often and scraping a spatula along the bottom of the pot to prevent sticking.
5.  Stir in the beans, thyme, and vinegar.
6.  Pour filling over the bottom pie crust, add top crust. In a small bowl, scramble egg with some water, and brush over the top of the pie.
7.  Bake for ~30-35 minutes, until golden brown on top.

## Rebecca’s Notes:

* Filling needs more salt - try at least a whole tsp next time.
* Forgot to add peas, next time add in ~½ cup of frozen peas.
* Pie had a bit of a soggy bottom. I had baked it with a baking sheet on the rack below the pie dish, this might have shielded the dish from the heat of the oven. Next time try without the baking sheet, or place the pie dish directly on a preheated baking sheet.
* This filling comes together well while the pie crust is chilling in the fridge.
