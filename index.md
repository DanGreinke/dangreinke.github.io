# Integer Recipes

These are recipes that we’ve scaled up or modified slightly so that they use up ingredients in the units that they are typically sold in at supermarkets. For example, no using up 1.5 cans of tomatoes - instead we change the recipe to use an integer number of cans, 1 or 2. We want to avoid having that half-can of something go bad in the back of the fridge, buying a huge bunch of herbs just to use a few tiny leaves, or having that awkward 4 oz of pasta sitting at the back of the pantry.

We have a few exceptions to this integer rule for practicality. These exceptions have to meet one of these criteria:
1. Long shelf-life. It needs to last at least a few weeks in its typical storage conditions (room temp, fridge, or freezer).
2. If it’s perishable, it needs to be commonly used in our kitchen so that it will get used up before spoiling.
