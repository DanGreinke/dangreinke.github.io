# Mac & Cheese (Vegetarian)
Adapted from Food Network

## Ingredients

* Kosher Salt
* 1 lb elbow macaroni
* 4 cups whole milk (1 quart)
* 12 tbsp unsalted butter
* ½ cup all-purpose flour
* 12 oz grated gruyere cheese
* 8 oz grated sharp cheddar
* 2 tsp salt
* ½ tsp freshly ground pepper
* 2 cups panko bread crumbs

## Directions

1.  Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2.  Cook pasta al dente according to the package directions. Drain well.
3.  Heat the milk in the microwave until hot.
4.  In a large pot, melt 6 tablespoons of the butter and add the flour. Cook over low heat for 2 minutes, stirring constantly with a whisk.
5.  Still whisking, add the hot milk and cook for 1-2 minutes, until thickened and smooth.
6.  Take the pot off the heat, then add the gruyere, cheddar, salt, and pepper. Stir until the cheese melts.
7.  Stir in the cooked pasta.
8.  Pile the mixture into a 9” x 13” baking dish.
9.  Melt the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter and combine with the panko breadcrumbs.
10. Sprinkle the panko mixture on top of the mac and cheese.
11. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until the sauce is bubbly and the crumbs are browned on top.

## Rebecca’s Notes

* The original recipe contained chicken, we omitted it to make this vegetarian-friendly. If adding chicken, add 2 cups of cooked chicken.
* This recipe has great texture but we thought it’s a little on the plain side flavor-wise without the chicken - serving with some cayenne pepper on top helps. For future batches we’re thinking of spices to put into the cheese sauce itself.
* If you buy the cheese in packages as close as you can to this listed weights, this is an integer recipe :)
